## 1. Overview

- Provide a modular and customizable structure for user preferences.

---

- Emacs on Debian/Ubuntu stable.
- Emacs built from source (23.4 or later).
- Emacs for macOS (from [emacsformacosx.com](http://emacsformacosx.com/)).

## 3. Installation

Run the `install_dotemacs.sh` script to install DOT\_EMACS:

### Usage:

```bash
# Install dot_emacs
#  $1 = emacs's binary path
#  $2 = installation target
#  $3 = nosudo
```

### Default Installation:

```bash
~/dot_emacs/install_dotemacs.sh
```

This installs DOT\_EMACS to the default location. Root privileges (via `sudo`) are required.

### Custom Installation:

```bash
~/dot_emacs/install_dotemacs.sh /usr/bin/emacs ~/.emacs.d nosudo
```

This installs DOT\_EMACS to `~/.emacs.d`, bypassing the need for `sudo`.

---

## 4. Default Behavior

DOT\_EMACS:

- Configures Emacs with preinstalled third-party libraries for enhanced functionality.
- Loads user-specific configurations from the ~/.emacs.d/elisp/ directory, including init.el and additional settings if available.
